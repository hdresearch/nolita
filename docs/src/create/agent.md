# /agent

The /agent folder of a Nolita project concerns itself with setting up a chat completion API and passing it to the [Agent class](../reference/agent.html).

## Supported models

All OpenAI and Anthropic text-mode models are supported.

While we currently predominantly support OpenAI and Anthropic models, you can also write your own chat completion API for any model. For more information, see the [Agent reference document](../reference/agent.html).
